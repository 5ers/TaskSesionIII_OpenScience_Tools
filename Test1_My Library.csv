Open Science hat das Potenzial, die Produktion und Verbreitung von wissenschaftlichem Wissen positiv zu verändern; es existiert aber keine gemeinsam geteilte Vision, die das System wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation beschreibt, welches wir erschaffen wollen. Zwischen April 2015 und Juni 2016 trafen sich in Wien die Mitglieder der Open Access Network Austria (OANA) Arbeitsgruppe ""Open Access and Scholarly Communication"", um diese Angelegenheit zu diskutieren. Das Hauptergebnis unserer Überlegungen sind zwölf Prinzipien, die die Eckpfeiler eines künftigen wissenschaftlichen Kommunikationssystems dedarstellen. Diese Prinzipien sollen einen kohärenten Bezugsrahmen für die Debatte zur Verbesserung des derzeitigen Systems liefern. Mit diesem Dokument hoffen wir, eine breite Diskussion über eine gemeinsame Vision für die wissenschaftliche Kommunikation im 21. Jahrhundert anzustoßen.","2016-12-30","2020-10-23 15:49:17","2020-10-23 15:49:17","2020-10-23 15:49:17","436-446","","3-4","69","","Mitteilungen der VÖB","The Vienna Principles","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\abouygue\Zotero\storage\KXQ6SBLD\Kraker et al. - 2016 - The Vienna Principles A Vision for Scholarly Comm.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
