,Discover Collectively Open Science Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/) to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human Brain Project,"It's a research infrastructure to help advance neuroscience, medicine, and computing",2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,43,They have a lot of events,"Not much improvement, it's a really big project with a lot of small projects in it divided into 6 groups"
Event Horizon Telescope,The Event Horizon Telescope is an international collaboration capturing images of black holes using a virtual Earth-sized telescope.,2,3,3,5,5,5,4,5,2,5,39,It is a project solely dedicated observing and publishing facts and findings about Black Holes and related topics in astronomic technology. ,"For me, it is quite difficult to understand each article because of my limited knowledge. It would be nicer if there is a section that provides definition for each scientific terms or a section that provides knowledge for a beginner in astrology."
Science Feedback,"Science Feedback is a web-based international fact-checking network whose major work is to gather notable scientists in health sciences, environmental sciences, etc. to validate scientific fiction and media coverage and publishes articles to inform global readers about trustworthy facts/news and vice versa ",3,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,47,This project is a hugh network of experts in health sciences and environmental sciences. Each review includes many opinions and trustworthy data contributed by professional scientists. The outline of the website is clear and well-categorised.,"It would be nice to add more reviews on Social Sciences, Humanities or Politics. On the other hands, the objective of this project is clear to be a health and climate fact-checking sources."
Open Worm,"Building an ""open source digital life form"" that mimics a simple nervous system",3,3,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,44,"This is very open-sourced and calls on very diverse talents, not just talent in science or tech. The inclusion of artists and writers for example creates a very well-rounded platform and community for sharing.",On the surface it seems intimidating (as someone without a tech background). But other than that it seems really innovative and useful for sharing knowledge and information.
Safecast,A device that mesure air quality and radiations.,3,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,46,This project have a real impact by providing a worldwide database on radiations and air quality.,It would be nice to add more languages on the website and maybe bring some explanatory videos to let the website be more interactive and understable.
SenseBox,Environmental Testing For All,3,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,45,"They have three different products corresponding to different citizen science needs, and it seems highly accessible. There is a forum for sharing questions, and areas to share data and results, promoting peer-to-peer learning through Open Science principles. It is a great way to familiarize students and regular citizens to data collection practices, which is fantastic.","Not so much an improvement, but since the application and devices are so new, it is difficult to find reviews on the products, other than in the forum. They should also expand to inclue more languages on their website besides English and German."
Kiron ,Free learning access for refugees ,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,48,"Free access to the users
Different parnertships to increase the value propositionm, outcomes and reach more users
Engaging with users to improve tthe project development
Agile methodology for the internal process
Digital plattform ","- Coursed made in the languages used by refugees, it could be done torugh the NGO`s parnertships
-Access to the courses needs basic digital skills, that needs to be considered in the interpretation of the results,  even Kiron are offering a digital skills course, because the benefits are focus on a specific group of refugees (people with digital skills, with 3G mobiles and access to the  internet data)"
